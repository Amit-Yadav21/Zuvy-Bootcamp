React Basics (Components, JSX, Props, State, etc.) ----------------------------------------
Q. What is React?
- React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications

Q. What are components in React?
- Reusable pieces of UI that can hold their own state and props.

Q. What is JSX?
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and makes it easier to write React components. Behind the scenes, React converts JSX into regular JavaScript, so the browser can understand it.

Q. What is the difference between functional and class components?
- Class components use ES6 classes and can manage state, while functional components are simpler functions.

Q. What is state in React?
- State is a built-in object that allows components to store and manage dynamic data. It holds information about a component.

Q. What are props in React?
- Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and allow data to be passed to child components.

Q. What are default props?
- Default props are values that a component uses if no value is provided.

Q. What are render props?
- Render props are a way to share code between components by passing a function as a prop. This function lets the component decide what to display.

Q. What is the children prop in React?
- The children prop allows you to pass JSX or components between the opening and closing tags of a component.

Q. What is the virtual DOM?
- A lightweight copy of the actual DOM used for efficient updates.

Q. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?
- Controlled components have their value managed by React via state, while uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to handle their own state using refs.

React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.) ------------------------------
Q. What are hooks in React?
- Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

Q. How does useState work?
- useState is a Hook that allows you to add state to functional components.

Q. What is useEffect used for?
- useEffect is a Hook that allows you to perform side effects in your components (e.g., fetching data, subscriptions).

Q. What is the purpose of useEffect?
- A hook for managing side effects in functional components.

Q. What is ref in React?
- A ref is a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements directly within React. It's often used to manipulate or access DOM elements imperatively.

Q. What is useRef in React?
- useRef is a hook that returns a mutable ref object which does not cause re-renders when its value is updated. It’s used to reference DOM elements or store persistent values.

Q. What is useMemo in React?
- useMemo is a hook that memoizes a computed value, ensuring that a function is only recomputed when its dependencies change, optimizing performance.

Q. How can you fetch data with useEffect only once when the component mounts?
- By passing an empty array [] as the second argument to useEffect, the effect runs only once after the component mounts.

Q. What is the purpose of the useReducer hook?
- useReducer is used to manage more complex state logic in React by providing a reducer function to handle different state changes based on actions.

Q. Can you use multiple useState or useEffect in a single component?
- Yes, you can use multiple useState or useEffect hooks in one component.

Q. What is the purpose of custom hooks in React?
- Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate reusable logic in a function that can be shared between components. They help keep components clean and abstract common logic.

Q. What is the purpose of custom hooks in React?
- Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate reusable logic in a function that can be shared between components. They help keep components clean and abstract common logic.
    function useFetch(url) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch(url)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => {
            setData(data);
            setLoading(false);
        });
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading };
    }

Q. Can you use multiple custom hooks in a single component?
- Yes, you can use as many custom hooks as needed in a component. Each hook operates independently and can manage its own state and side effects.

Q. How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders when using useEffect?
- You can prevent unnecessary re-renders by ensuring that the dependencies array passed to useEffect only contains values that, when changed, should trigger a re-render.

-----------------------------------------

React Routing -----------------------------------------
Q. What is React Router?
- React Router is a library that allows you to implement routing in a React application. It allows you to navigate between different parts of your app without refreshing the page.

Q. How do you create routes in React?
- You use the Route component from react-router-dom to define different paths and link them to components.

Q. What is the difference between <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter>?
- <BrowserRouter> uses HTML5 history API, while <HashRouter> uses the URL hash (#) for navigation.

Q. How do you navigate programmatically in React Router?
- You can use the useNavigate hook or the history.push() method in older versions to navigate programmatically.

- I use event.preventDefault() inside the form's submit handler.

Q. What is a controlled component in React forms?
- A controlled component is one whose value is controlled by React’s state, ensuring the form element value is always synced with the state.

Q. How do you handle multiple input fields in a form?
- I can handle multiple input fields by using a dynamic key in the state object, updating the field based on event.target.name.

Q. What is onChange event in React?
- The onChange event is triggered whenever the value of an input field changes. It is used to update the component's state based on user input.
-------------------------------------------------------

State Management (Context API, Redux) ----------------------------------------------
Q. What is Context API?
- The Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. It allows you to share data between components without prop drilling .

Q. What is context in React?
- A way to share values across components without passing props manually.

Q. What is Redux?
- Redux is a state management library that helps you manage your application's state in a predictable way. It works with React through the react-redux library.

Q. What are the main principles of Redux?
- The three principles are:
    Single source of truth (store).
    State is read-only.
    Changes are made with pure functions (reducers).

Q. What is the useContext hook in React?
- The useContext hook allows you to access values from the Context API without needing to pass props down manually at each level of the component tree.

Q. What is the Provider component in the Context API?
- The Provider component allows you to wrap a part of your React component tree and provide a context value to all components within that tree.

Q. How does Redux help manage state in larger applications?
- Redux centralizes the state management in a global store, which can be accessed by any component, reducing the need to pass state via props and improving state predictability.

Q. What are Redux actions?
- Redux actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. Each action must have a type property.

Q. What are Redux reducers?
- Redux reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as input and return a new state based on the action's type.

Q. How do you dispatch an action in Redux?
- You dispatch an action using the dispatch function provided by Redux, which triggers a state change via the reducer.

Q. What is useSelector in Redux, and how does it work?
- useSelector is a hook that allows you to extract and subscribe to specific parts of the Redux store's state in functional components.
    const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter);

Q. What is useDispatch in Redux, and how is it used?
- useDispatch is a hook that gives you access to the dispatch function in Redux, allowing you to dispatch actions from within a React component.

Q. What is Redux Thunk, and how does it work with React?
- Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can dispatch actions asynchronously, such as when fetching data from an API.

Q. How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux without Thunk?
- Without Redux Thunk, you can handle asynchronous actions using other middleware like Redux-Saga, which provides a more declarative way to manage side effects in Redux.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Performance Optimization (React.memo, useCallback, etc.) --------------------------------------------
Q. What is React.memo?
- React.memo is a higher-order component that prevents re-rendering of a component if its props have not changed.

Q. How does useCallback help in performance?
- useCallback memoizes a function and ensures the function is not recreated unless its dependencies change, improving performance.

Q. How do you optimize rendering in React?
- I can optimize rendering by using React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and ensuring that components only update when necessary (e.g., by comparing props)

Q. What are React fragments?
- React fragments (<></>) allow you to return multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Q. What is code splitting in React?
- Code splitting is a technique used to split the code into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary parts of the application. It can be done using dynamic imports or React’s lazy and Suspense.

Q. What is reconciliation in React?
- Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updating the parts that have changed.

Q. How does React’s key prop affect reconciliation?
- React uses the key prop to identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed, which helps in optimizing the reconciliation process by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

Q. What is React.PureComponent, and how does it differ from React.Component?
- React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component, but it implements a shallow comparison in shouldComponentUpdate, preventing unnecessary re-renders if the component's props and state haven’t changed.

Q. What is code splitting, and how does it work in React?
- Code splitting allows you to split your app’s code into separate bundles so that only the necessary parts of your app are loaded initially. In React, it’s commonly done using React.lazy() and Suspense for lazy-loading components.

Q. What is tree shaking in React?
- Tree shaking is a technique used in the build process to remove unused code from the final bundle, helping reduce the bundle size. React’s build tools, like Webpack, can automatically tree shake unused components and functions.
