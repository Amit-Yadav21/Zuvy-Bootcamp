React Basics (Components, JSX, Props, State, etc.) ----------------------------------------
Q. What is React?
- React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications

Q. What are components in React?
- Reusable pieces of UI that can hold their own state and props.

Q. What is JSX?
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and makes it easier to write React components. Behind the scenes, React converts JSX into regular JavaScript, so the browser can understand it.

Q. What is a fragment in React?
- A fragment groups multiple children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Q. What is the difference between functional and class components?
- Class components use ES6 classes and can manage state, while functional components are simpler functions.

Q. What is state in React?
- State is a built-in object that allows components to store and manage dynamic data. It holds information about a component.

Q. What are props in React?
- Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and allow data to be passed to child components.

Q. What are default props?
- Default props are values that a component uses if no value is provided.

Q. What are render props?
- Render props are a way to share code between components by passing a function as a prop. This function lets the component decide what to display.

Q. What is the children prop in React?
- The children prop allows you to pass JSX or components between the opening and closing tags of a component.

Q. What is a key in React, and why is it important? What is the purpose of keys in React lists?
- The key prop is a special attribute used in lists to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. the purpose of keys is Uniqueness, Efficient Updates and Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders.

Q. What is the virtual DOM?
- A lightweight copy of the actual DOM used for efficient updates.

Q. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?
- Controlled components have their value managed by React via state, while uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to handle their own state using refs.
Controlled components manage their state through React, while uncontrolled components manage their state through the DOM.

Q. What is the purpose of render() in a React component?
- The main purpose of render() is to update the UI based on the current state or props. the render() method in a React component decides what to show on the screen. It returns the layout (JSX) that will be displayed in the browser.
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
            <div>
                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
            </div>
            );
        }
    }

Q. How can you test React components?
- By using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to simulate interactions and assertions.

Q. What is the significance of React.StrictMode?
- It helps identify potential problems in an application by intentionally invoking additional checks and warnings.

Q. How can you create a custom hook?
- To create a custom hook in React, you simply write a JavaScript function that uses one or more built-in React hooks (like useState, useEffect, useReducer, etc.). The custom hook allows you to extract and reuse logic across different components.

Q. How do you handle authentication in a React app?
- By using context or state management libraries to manage authentication state and protect routes.

React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.) ------------------------------
Q. What are hooks in React?
- Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

Q. How does useState work?
- useState is a Hook that allows you to add state to functional components.

Q. How does useReducer differ from useState?
- useReducer and useState are both hooks in React for managing state, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.
- useState: This hook is used for managing simple state. You can have multiple state variables, each with its own setter function.
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    };

- useReducer: This hook is used for managing more complex state logic. It allows you to manage state based on actions, making it easier to handle multiple state updates that depend on each other.
    const initialState = { count: 0 };

    function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
        throw new Error();
    }
    }

    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    const increment = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
    };

Q. What is useEffect?
- useEffect is a hook for performing side effects, like data fetching, in functional components.

Q. What is useEffect used for?
- useEffect is a Hook that allows you to perform side effects in your components (e.g., fetching data, subscriptions).

Q. How do you handle side effects in a functional component?
- By using the useEffect hook to perform actions after rendering.

Q. What is the purpose of useEffect?
- A hook for managing side effects in functional components.

Q. What is ref in React?
- A ref is a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements directly within React. It's often used to manipulate or access DOM elements imperatively.

Q. What is useRef in React?
- useRef is a hook that returns a mutable ref object which does not cause re-renders when its value is updated. It’s used to reference DOM elements or store persistent values.

Q. What is useMemo in React?
- useMemo is a hook that memoizes a computed value, ensuring that a function is only recomputed when its dependencies change, optimizing performance.

Q. How can you fetch data with useEffect only once when the component mounts?
- By passing an empty array [] as the second argument to useEffect, the effect runs only once after the component mounts.

Q. What is the purpose of the useReducer hook?
- useReducer is used to manage more complex state logic in React by providing a reducer function to handle different state changes based on actions.

Q. Can you use multiple useState or useEffect in a single component?
- Yes, you can use multiple useState or useEffect hooks in one component.

Q. What is the purpose of custom hooks in React?
- Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate reusable logic in a function that can be shared between components. They help keep components clean and abstract common logic.
    function useFetch(url) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch(url)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => {
            setData(data);
            setLoading(false);
        });
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading };
    }

Q. Can you use multiple custom hooks in a single component?
- Yes, you can use as many custom hooks as needed in a component. Each hook operates independently and can manage its own state and side effects.

Q. What are custom hooks?
- Functions that let you extract and reuse stateful logic in functional components.

Q. How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders when using useEffect?
- You can prevent unnecessary re-renders by ensuring that the dependencies array passed to useEffect only contains values that, when changed, should trigger a re-render.

-----------------------------------------

React Routing -----------------------------------------
Q. What is React Router?
- React Router is a library that allows you to implement routing in a React application. It allows you to navigate between different parts of your app without refreshing the page.

Q. How do you create routes in React?
- You use the Route component from react-router-dom to define different paths and link them to components.

Q. What is the difference between <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter>?
- <BrowserRouter> uses HTML5 history API, while <HashRouter> uses the URL hash (#) for navigation.

Q. How do you navigate programmatically in React Router?
- You can use the useNavigate hook or the history.push() method in older versions to navigate programmatically.

Q. What is lazy loading in React, and how do you implement it in routing?
- Lazy loading allows you to load components only when they are needed. You can implement it in React using React.lazy() and Suspense for route components.

Q. How do you optimize performance in a React application?

Q. How can you optimize performance in a large React application?
- By implementing memoization, lazy loading, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders with hooks like useMemo and useCallback.

Q. What is the difference between Link and NavLink in React Router?
- Link is used for navigation between routes, while NavLink is a special type of Link that adds styling to the active route.
-------------------------------------------------------

Forms and Events (Handling Forms, Event Handling) --------------------------------------
Q. How do you handle forms in React?
- By using controlled components with state or uncontrolled components with refs.

Q. How can you manage forms with validation in React?
- By using controlled components along with validation libraries like Formik or Yup.

Q. How do you handle events in React?
- I can handle events in React by passing event handlers (like onClick or onChange) to JSX elements. Event listeners are added directly to JSX elements using camelCase syntax .

Q. How do you prevent the default form submit behavior in React?
- I use event.preventDefault() inside the form's submit handler.

Q. What is a controlled component in React forms?
- A controlled component is one whose value is controlled by React’s state, ensuring the form element value is always synced with the state.

Q. How do you handle multiple input fields in a form?
- I can handle multiple input fields by using a dynamic key in the state object, updating the field based on event.target.name.

Q. What is onChange event in React?
- The onChange event is triggered whenever the value of an input field changes. It is used to update the component's state based on user input.
-------------------------------------------------------

State Management (Context API, Redux) ----------------------------------------------
Q. What is Context API? and how is it used?
- The Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. It allows you to share data between components without prop drilling .

Q. What is context in React?
- A way to share values across components without passing props manually.

Q. What is Redux?
- Redux is a state management library that helps you manage your application's state in a predictable way. It works with React through the react-redux library.

Q. What are the main principles of Redux?
- The three principles are:
    Single source of truth (store).
    State is read-only.
    Changes are made with pure functions (reducers).

Q. What is the useContext hook in React?
- The useContext hook allows you to access values from the Context API without needing to pass props down manually at each level of the component tree.

Q. What is the Provider component in the Context API?
- The Provider component allows you to wrap a part of your React component tree and provide a context value to all components within that tree.

Q. How does Redux help manage state in larger applications?
- Redux centralizes the state management in a global store, which can be accessed by any component, reducing the need to pass state via props and improving state predictability.

Q. What are Redux actions?
- Redux actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. Each action must have a type property.

Q. What are Redux reducers?
- Redux reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as input and return a new state based on the action's type.

Q. How do you dispatch an action in Redux?
- You dispatch an action using the dispatch function provided by Redux, which triggers a state change via the reducer.

Q. What is useSelector in Redux, and how does it work?
- useSelector is a hook that allows you to extract and subscribe to specific parts of the Redux store's state in functional components.
    const counter = useSelector((state) => state.counter);

Q. What is useDispatch in Redux, and how is it used?
- useDispatch is a hook that gives you access to the dispatch function in Redux, allowing you to dispatch actions from within a React component.

Q. What is Redux Thunk, and how does it work with React?
- Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can dispatch actions asynchronously, such as when fetching data from an API.

Q. How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux without Thunk?
- Without Redux Thunk, you can handle asynchronous actions using other middleware like Redux-Saga, which provides a more declarative way to manage side effects in Redux.

Performance Optimization (React.memo, useCallback, etc.) --------------------------------------------
Q. What is React.memo?
- React.memo is a higher-order component that prevents re-rendering of a component if its props have not changed.

Q. What is the purpose of React.memo?
- A higher-order component that prevents re-renders of functional components when props haven't changed.

Q. What is useCallback in React, and why would you use it?
- useCallback is a hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function, which prevents the function from being recreated on every render. This is useful when passing functions as props to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Q. What is the purpose of useCallback?
- To memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-creations on re-renders.

Q. How does useCallback help in performance?
- useCallback memoizes a function and ensures the function is not recreated unless its dependencies change, improving performance.

Q. How do you optimize rendering in React?
- I can optimize rendering by using React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and ensuring that components only update when necessary (e.g., by comparing props)

Q. What are React fragments?
- React fragments (<></>) allow you to return multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Q. How does React handle updates to state that depend on the previous state?
- To handle updates based on the previous state, you should pass a function to setState or setCount instead of a direct value.

Q. What is code splitting in React?
- Code splitting is a technique used to split the code into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary parts of the application. It can be done using dynamic imports or React’s lazy and Suspense.

Q. What is code splitting?
- Code splitting divides your code into smaller pieces that load only when needed, improving load times.

Q. What is reconciliation in React?
- Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updating the parts that have changed.

Q. How does React’s key prop affect reconciliation?
- React uses the key prop to identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed, which helps in optimizing the reconciliation process by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

Q. What is React.PureComponent, and how does it differ from React.Component?
- React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component, but it implements a shallow comparison in shouldComponentUpdate, preventing unnecessary re-renders if the component's props and state haven’t changed.

Q. What is code splitting, and how does it work in React?
- Code splitting allows you to split your app’s code into separate bundles so that only the necessary parts of your app are loaded initially. In React, it’s commonly done using React.lazy() and Suspense for lazy-loading components.

Q. What is tree shaking in React?
- Tree shaking is a technique used in the build process to remove unused code from the final bundle, helping reduce the bundle size. React’s build tools, like Webpack, can automatically tree shake unused components and functions.

Q. What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?
- useMemo:
  - Memoizes a value.
  - Returns the cached result of an expensive calculation.
  - Recomputes the value only when the dependencies change.
  - Used for optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
  - Example use case: Caching filtered data or a calculated value.

- useCallback:
  - Memoizes a function.
  - Returns the cached function, preventing it from being recreated on every render.
  - Useful when passing functions to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Example use case: Caching event handlers or callbacks that depend on props or state.

- Key Difference:
- useMemo: Caches values.
- useCallback: Caches functions.

Q. How do you set up server-side rendering (SSR) in React?
- Server-side rendering (SSR) in React is typically set up using frameworks like Next.js or by configuring React with Express.js to render React components on the server before sending the HTML to the client.

Q. What is the difference between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR)?
- SSR generates HTML on the server before sending it to the client, while CSR renders HTML in the browser after the initial load.

Q. What is static site generation (SSG), and how is it different from SSR?
- Static Site Generation (SSG) generates static HTML at build time, while Server-Side Rendering (SSR) generates HTML on each request. SSG is faster as the HTML is pre-built, while SSR can deliver more dynamic content.

Q. What is server-side rendering (SSR)?
- SSR means rendering React components on the server before sending them to the client, improving load time and SEO.
.....................................................................................

What are Suspense boundaries, and why are they useful?
A95: Suspense boundaries allow you to specify fallback content (e.g., a loading spinner) for parts of your app that are waiting for asynchronous operations like data fetching or code splitting. This improves user experience by preventing blank screens during loading.

Advanced React -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
- Higher-order components are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component. They are used to reuse logic across multiple components.
    const withAuth = (Component) => {
    return (props) => {
        if (!props.isAuthenticated) return <Redirect to="/login" />;
        return <Component {...props} />;
    };
    };

Q. What is render prop pattern in React?
- The render prop pattern is a technique where a component’s prop is a function that returns JSX. It allows for greater flexibility in reusing component logic.

Q. How does the render prop pattern differ from HOCs?
- HOCs wrap components to add behavior, while the render prop pattern allows a component to share logic through a function passed as a prop. Render props give more control over what gets rendered.

Q. How does the shouldComponentUpdate method work?
- It allows you to optimize component rendering by preventing updates when unnecessary.

Q. What are the benefits of using TypeScript with React?
- TypeScript provides static type checking, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors.

Q. What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
- useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after all DOM mutations, while useEffect runs asynchronously.
