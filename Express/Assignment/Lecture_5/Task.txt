1. Create logger middleware which shows 
METHOD DOMAIN NAME or HOSTNAME and PATH
Example: GET http://localhost:3000/users

2. Add errorHandler middleware to the Cart API that you created in last assignment.
3. If user goes on not existing path instead of a HTML response show a JSON response using middleware.
